# FalloutWithFallout

FalloutWithFallout is a website that allows users to create arbitration forms quickly and easily while also giving them the chance to let us send it for them for a fee.

During this project, i had learned a great deal in how Vue.JS works as well as how to make easy to use user interfaces. My next project, which is a replacement for Patreon, will feature everything I have learned so far
